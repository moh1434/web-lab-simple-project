      <h1>Foundation Story</h1>
      <section class="text">
        <p>
          Founded by three partners of French origin in 1988, LC Waikiki started
          its commercial life as a wholesale brand. Established and registered
          in Paris, LC Waikiki attracted attention with its t-shirt and
          sweatshirt designs in the first place. With the separation of the two
          founding partners of the brand in time, LC Waikiki was passed to
          George Amouyal as the sole shareholder. Tema Tekstil, which is
          connected to Taha Group and is the producer as well as licensor of LC
          Waikiki in Turkey, bought the worldwide rights of the LC Waikiki brand
          in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the purchase of all the rights of the brand, the name of Tema
          Tekstil, belonging to Taha Group, was changed to "LC Waikiki Retailing
          Services". The 7 percent share of the group was transferred to George
          Amouyal, from whom LC Waikiki's royalties were purchased. Although
          George Amouyal, of French origin, has not been actively involved in
          the management of LC Waikiki after the brand name transfer, he still
          holds 7 percent of our company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taha Group, founded in 1988, bought LC Waikiki, which was born in
          Paris but grew in Istanbul, and brought it to its current level. The
          adventure of our brand has started with the capital support of the
          shareholders of Taha Dış Ticaret, which carried out import and export
          operations in the iron and steel sector of the period, and Taha
          Tekstil, a start-up in which Mustafa Küçük took responsibility as a
          founder/managing partner. Taha Tekstil, located in Zeytinburnu, on a
          small area of approximately 150 square meters on the ground floor of
          an apartment building, was established as a sample sewing and cutting
          workshop. Taha Tekstil, which exports clothing based on contract
          manufacturing, met with LC Waikiki via an intermediary marketer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon receipt of an order of approximately ten thousand pieces of
          monkey t-shirts of LC Waikiki which were very popular at that time and
          mostly produced in countries such as India, Korea and Greece, Taha
          Tekstil began to organize the contract manufacturing of the brand in
          Turkey. Taha Tekstil has verged to production investments over time in
          order to meet LC Waikiki's increasing order, printing, embroidery,
          label, quality and short-term production demands. These investments
          were made by establishing separate profit-centered companies managed
          by different founding/managing partners as start-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
          The companies, which were established as printing, embroidery, label,
          knitted fabric, knitted dyehouse and different clothing workshops
          between 1990-1994, were gathered under the roof of Taha Holding, whose
          General Coordinator was Mustafa Küçük in 1994. Taha Tekstil, and later
          Taha Holding, was established by Şefik Yılmaz Dizdar as the
          shareholder partner and Mustafa Küçük, the founder/managing partner,
          with a 50 percent partnership each. In the following period, 10
          percent of the share of Taha Tekstil, the parent company, was
          transferred to İsmail Hakkı Kısacık, the production manager at that
          time, and the number of shareholders of Taha Tekstil and Taha Holding
          increased to three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the founding/managing partners responsible for the
          management of each company established within Taha Holding are not
          shareholders in the parent company, they have joined the Taha Group
          family due to the partnership shares of the companies under their
          management. After Taha Tekstil started production of LC Waikiki for
          export, as the famous monkey t-shirt models of that period were in
          great demand in the domestic market, Turkey license of LC Waikiki was
          acquired by Taha Holding via Tema Tekstil which was established in
          1991. Then, Turkey’s domestic market was penetrated via wholesale
          trading and corner dealers.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        Mustafa Küçük's brother, Vahap Küçük was appointed as the founder /
        managing partner of Tema Tekstil, which was established by Taha Holding
        to manage the wholesale organization of LC Waikiki in the domestic
        market. Our first retail LC Waikiki store was opened on Şişli
        Halaskargazi Street. Despite other retail stores were opened in
        different cities later on, our retail stores could not achieve the
        intended profitability and growth due to the financial crisis in 2000.
        During the financial crisis in 2000, in Taha Group companies which had
        difficulties in maintaining the cash flow balance and had to sell some
        production companies to meet their cash needs, the challenges brought by
        the experienced crisis prompted the management of the corporation to
        take radical decisions.

        <p>
          During this period, it was decided to separate the production group
          and the retail group from each other completely and to leave the
          wholesale dealership system and focus entirely on retailing. In line
          with these radical decisions, it was determined that the production
          companies shall focus on export under the roof of Taha Holding and
          under the Group Coordinator, İsmail Kısacık, who was responsible for
          production whereas Tema Holding and its affiliated Tema Mağazacılık,
          under the Chairmanship of Vahap Küçük and the CEO/Group Coordinator
          Mustafa Küçük, shall focus entirely on the retail sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Tema Holding and Tema Mağazacılık, merged under LC Waikiki, we
          act in line with our vision of becoming one of Europe's three most
          successful clothing brands until 2023. With our mission "everyone
          deserves to dress well", we continue to grow with our own stores
          domestic and abroad, and with our franchise partners in countries with
          legal obligations. With the factories established in various cities of
          Anatolia, we continue to work on the production and export of the
          world's leading brands. As of 2020, we are proud to reach 22.6 billion
          TL net sales, approximately 50 thousand employees, 845 million USD
          export and more than 1000 stores.
